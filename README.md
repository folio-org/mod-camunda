## Camunda Module Dependencies
This module extends spring-module-core and brings in Camunda BPM to enable workflow capabilities. Camunda is an open-source BPM platform that is embedded in this module via the following dependencies.
```

```
* camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter
    * Adds the Camunda engine (v7.9)
    * [https://docs.camunda.org/manual/develop/user-guide/spring-boot-integration/](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/develop/user-guide/spring-boot-integration/)
    * [https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter)
    * The Camunda engine requires a database schema to be configured on startup
        * Work is in progress to allow the module to start without any database creation and have the tenant creation perform the necessary table creation and initial data import
        * Details on the process engine database schema configuration can be foune [here](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/develop/user-guide/spring-boot-integration/configuration/)
* camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter-webapp
    * Enables Web Applications such as Camunda Cockpit and Tasklist
    * [https://docs.camunda.org/manual/develop/user-guide/spring-boot-integration/webapps/](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/develop/user-guide/spring-boot-integration/webapps/)
* camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter-rest
    * Enables the Camunda REST API
    * [https://docs.camunda.org/manual/develop/user-guide/spring-boot-integration/rest-api/](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/develop/user-guide/spring-boot-integration/rest-api/)
    * [https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.9/reference/rest/](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.9/reference/rest/)
    * The Camunda REST API uses Jersey so we use spring boot's common application properties to configure the path to be /camunda in the application.yml file
        * `spring.jersey.application-path=camunda`

## Workflow Project Structure
Business Process Models and Decision Models are built using the [Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.com/products/modeler/) which impelements BPMN 2.0 and DMN 1.1 specifications.

* .bpmn files are stored in `/src/main/java/resources/workflows`
* .dmn files are stored in `/src/main/java/resources/decisions`

Any Java code that is executed in the context of a process is usually written in a Java Delegate. These classes are stored in `/src/main/java/org/folio/rest/delegate/`

## Deploy and run the application
1. Run the application `mvn clean spring-boot:run`
    1. Note there is a hard dependency on ActiveMQ. If running without ActiveMQ, be sure to comment out `activemq.broker-url: tcp://localhost:61616` in the application.yml
2. Deploy all the processes by running scripts/deploy.sh file
3. Navigate to Camunda Portal `localhost:9000/app/welcome/default/#/welcome`
4. Log in as admin username: `admin`, password: `admin`

## ActiveMQ Message Broker
We are using ActiveMQ to consume messages. Currently we are only consuming, not producing messages. This is a hard dependency when running the application, so if you want to run the application without a message broker, comment out `activemq.broker-url: tcp://localhost:61616` in the application.yml

## FOLIO Integration
For detailed information to bring up a FOLIO instance refer to [https://github.com/folio-org/folio-ansible](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-ansible).

The following requires [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) 1.9.6 or above.

```
vagrant up
# wait
```

When finished Okapi will be running with mod-workflow and mod-camunda deployed under the diku tenant. mod-camunda will have its port forwarded for access to the Camunda webapps. FOLIO UI will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`; username: `diku_admin`, password: `admin`.

> Okapi is being built and redeployed from within this vagrant. Eventually this will not need to happen. If a specific branch of either mod-camunda or mod-workflow is desired to be deployed, modify the Vagrantfile `git checkout main` to the desired branch and restart vagrant. `vagrant destroy`, `vagrant up`

### Development

In order to facilitate development on mod-camunda in the context of Okapi, there is a sync directory from the host machine to the guest machine. The host directory is at `.vagrant/sync` and it will contain `okapi`, `mod-camunda`, and `mod-workflow`. The development and git branch management can be done on the host machine. The guest directory is at `/sync`. The redeployment of a module must be done from the guest machine.

```
vagrant ssh
sudo su
cd /sync
# kill mod-camunda running on port 9000
kill $(lsof -t -i :9000)
cd mod-camunda
mvn clean install
nohup java -jar target/mod-camunda-1.1.0.jar &
```

### Login

```
curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Okapi-Tenant: diku" http://localhost:9130/authn/login -d '{"username": "diku_admin", "password": "admin"}'
```

The response headers of interest are `X-Okapi-Token` and `refreshToken`.

### Refresh Token

```
curl -v -H "X-Okapi-Tenant: diku" -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:9130/refresh -d '{"refreshToken": "`[refresh token goes here]`"}'
```

The body of this response will contain the new `X-Okapi-Token`.

### Workflow Module Triggers

The Trigger entity from mod-workflow is used to select which request-response events from Okapi are to be published to the `event.queue` that mod-camunda can subscribe to. In order to create the Triggers we have to provide the correct permissions to the `diku_admin`. The vagrant will create an example trigger for when a user is created.

### Permissions

In order to call mod-camunda and mod-workflow through the Okapi gateway a user will need the appropriate permissions. In order to accommodate this the Vagrantfile runs a shell script in which updates permissions for `diku_admin`. Providing him with all permissions to all interfaces of mod-camunda and mod-workflow.

### Cleanup

When finished it will be desired to cleanup as the FOLIO vagrant uses a lot of resources.

```
vagrant destroy
rm -rf .vagrant/sync
```

> Removing the synced directory, `.vagrant/sync`, on the host will remove any changes during development that have not been pushed.
